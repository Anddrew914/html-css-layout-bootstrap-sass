# CSS: Layout with Bootstrap

## Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students should be able to:

- Integrate bootstrap with an existing project.
- Use bootstrap to create responsive site layouts.
- Reference bootstrap documentation for existing style class names.

## Instructions

1. Fork and clone this repo.
1. Change into the project directory.
1. Follow your instructor's instructions.

To add bootstrap to an existing project:

1. `npm install --save bootstrap` to download bootstrap and add it as a dependency.
1. Link to bootstrap CSS in `index.html`. Browse `node_modules` for the full path to the stylesheets you want.
1. Require the bootstrap JS as part of your `browserify` build.
1. Edit your layout (`index.html`) to include appropriate layout elements, including containers, rows, columns, etc.

## Bonus

For an extra challenge, make the header and footer sticky, even when the content doesn't fill the page.

Next, try using JavaScript to have the header and footer hide on `scrolldown` and display on `scrollup`.
